## Setup
### API Key:
The API key is from Google Cloud Console, and is **Not** included within the submission (for security purposes), as you must have an active Google Console account. To use this code, login/signup to Google Cloud Console, "get started" with Google Maps SDK, and enable (if not already) the "Static Maps API" feature.
<br>If enabled, copy the API key, and paste it into the "TBD", line "TBD" - replacing "YOUR_API_KEY" with your actual key.
